# ðŸŒ¸ Flower Classification with TensorFlow

A deep learning project using TensorFlow and Keras to classify flower images into five categories with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the publicly available `flower_photos` dataset and can predict the type of flower in new images.
